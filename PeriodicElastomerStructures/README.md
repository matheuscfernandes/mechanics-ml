# In this folder we generate the initial Model and data aquisition system to obtain the structures depicted by the JMPS paper: Relating pore shape to the non-linear response of periodic elastomeric structures

## For the first part, we look at reproducing the original results of this paper. We will continue implementing and creating a library for which we can integrate and predict varying geometries instabilities and interactions at the larger scale.
