# mechanics-ml

This folder contains the files for our project in incorporating machine learning to solving problems in mechanics. 

We can include all codes and commit different versions of the code, but I would refrain from adding large files such as .odb's or any otherlarge Abaqus files.

We can create a main (or master) code and branch off different pieces in which we work on. We can even include a .tex file for our workflow. 

I would also be careful including any binary files (including .pdf) in Github, as merging those files can be quite tricky. If we include any binary files, such as those we discussed to keep the data of the simulations, I would advise for us to work on separate versions of the file so that we can manually merge the data as needed.
